 * Conforming object provides a method that allows to turn the given file into an array of ThemeRules (also known as a

 * @param themeData The data of the file where the theme rules should be read from.
 * @param error Error object to inform of any possible failure during the parsing.
 * @return Theme object resulting of the translation or nil in case of error.
 *
 * @discussion It is up to the parser implementation determine the resiliency level expected of the parser, some parsers
 * could opt for ignore misformed rules and only translate the well formed ones. Other parsers could be more strict and
 * simply fail when expected tokens are found. In the latter cases, the expected the error object to be populated with
 * meaningful error messages.
